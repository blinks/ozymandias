# Resource Equivalencies
Current ideas for conversion rates.  Each row is one source resource and how
much of it you probably should need to make another resource.

## Wealth
* 1 = 3 movement.

## Strength
* 1 = 1 early game colony
* 2 = 1 mid game colony
* 3 = 1 late game colony
* 1 = 1 reinforcement.

## Secrets
* 1 = wild suit.

## Cards
* 1 = ~4 wealth.
* 1 = ~4 strength.
* 1 = ~4 secrets.
* 1 = ~4 towards skirmish in 1/3 sectors.

# Card Templating

The two core hooks for card effects (aside from static) are resolving an order
and dealing with a skirmish.
