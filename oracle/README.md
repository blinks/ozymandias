# Print & Play Notes

## Components
* Some cool piece (I use an Icehouse pyramid) to mark first player.
* Cards, available in this directory. (`rake pnp`)
* A set of 2.2‚Äù tri-hex sector tiles. (assets coming with #36)
* A collection of resources in three colors (strength, wealth, secrets).
* For each player [grey, green, blue, black?, brown, yellow, red]
  * A set of four numbered (or otherwise labeled 15mm x 10mm cylinder) fleet pawns -- I draw the numbers on with permanent marker.
  * A set of eight colonies (colored 15mm x 4mm disks).

# Resource Equivalencies
Current ideas for conversion rates.  Each row is one source resource and how
much of it you probably should need to make another resource.

## Wealth
* 1-3 = 3 movement.

## Strength
* 1 = 1 early game colony
* 2 = 1 mid game colony
* 3 = 1 late game colony
* 1 = 1 reinforcement.

## Secrets
* 1 = wild suit.

## Cards
* 1 = ~4 wealth.
* 1 = ~4 strength.
* 1 = ~4 secrets.
* 1 = ~4 towards skirmish in 1/3 sectors.
