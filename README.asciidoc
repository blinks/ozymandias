== Introduction

[verse, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Ozymandias]
____
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

_Rise_ is a 2- to 4-player board game depicting the life cycle of space-faring
civilizations over millennia.  Each player takes the role of a powerful
immortal seeking to have the most influence over humanity, whether benevolent
investment or malevolent destruction.

== Components
A complete set of _Rise_ includes:

* 27 hexagonal sector tiles.
* A deck of 52 cards, in four different colors.
* 24 black, blue, red, and white wooden disks.
* Gems: white (1s) and red (5s).
* This rule book.

=== The Galaxy Map
The map is divided into hexagonal Sectors, each with a numeric value.  A sector
is a vast expanse of space arbitrarily reduced to a single number from zero to
four.

Each sector is considered Controlled by a single color, or it is uncontrolled.
A sector is considered Controlled by a color if that color's disk is on top of
all other disks in the sector.

.Sector control
====
A sector with no disks on it is uncontrolled.

A sector with a single disk on it is controlled by that disk's color.

A sector with two or more disks on it is controlled by the top disk's color.
====

The stack of disks in a sector serves as a historical record of control in that
sector.  Civilizations that collapse reveal earlier disks, who retake control.

Some cards can destroy a sector.  When a sector is destroyed, flip it
face-down and take any disks on it for yourself. If the sector was not placed
in the galaxy (it was just drawn and destroyed), put it at the bottom of the
sector pile.

=== Cards
The deck of cards represents archetypical historical events, the kind that get
referenced in speech enough to become a stand-in for anything similar.  Each
card has a color of civilization that it influences, a title, and some rules
text.

When a player explores a new sector, everyone bids for the ability to expand
the range of powers their immortal avatars wield. Cards may be played to Expand
with their color.  Cards may also be Consumed to gain gems.

You place purchased and played cards on your own personal discard piles.  At
the start of your turn, you may pay gems equal to the number of cards left in
your hand to draw back your entire discard pile.  You then take your turn.

Destroyed cards are placed face-up in the dead pile.

=== Civilization Disks
Six wooden disks of each color represent archetypical civilizations.

At the beginning of the game, these have yet to rise to any real place in the
galaxy, and all sit in a pool at the side of the table.  Players move them from
the pool to the galaxy as civilizations expand.  Players take them from the
galaxy to their private banks as civilizations collapse.

A game of _Rise_ lasts only as long as there are disks in the common pool.  At
the end of the turn where the last civ is removed from the pool, the game ends.

== Set Up
. Shuffle the sector tiles and the deck of cards.
. Place the disks in a common pool reachable by all players.
. Give nine gems to each player to make their initial banks.

== Game Sequence
On your turn, you must *explore*, *expand*, or *consume*.  At the end of your
turn, if there are no disks left in the common pool, the game ends.  Otherwise,
play proceeds clockwise to the next player.

Before you take an action, you may pay gems equal to the number of cards left
in your hand to recover your discard pile.  You still take a turn afterwards.

=== Explore
Explore new sectors to the galaxy and bid for control of the cards that emerge.

. Draw sectors one at a time until their total value is at least equal to the
  number of players.
. Draw cards equal to that total value and place them face-up for players to
  see.
. Secretly and simultaneously bid gems.
.. From the high-bidder down, players pay their bid to take a card from those
   revealed -- place it on your discard pile or in your hand.
.. In the case of a tie, proceed in play order, starting from the active
   player.
.. Players aren't forced to take cards. If you don't take a card, don't lose
   your bid.

=== Expand
Conquer a sector of the galaxy with a color in your hand.

. Play a card from your hand to your discard pile.
. Place a disk of its color on a sector tile.
.. If there are no disks of that color, your turn ends.
.. If that color controls any sectors, you must place it adjacent to one.
.. Otherwise, you may place it on any sector.
. Gain gems equal to that sector's value.
. Starting with the next player clockwise, each player resolves their top card
  if it matches any color disk in that sector.
.. If the card matches the color you placed, resolve the conquering effect.
.. Otherwise, resolve the conquered effect.

=== Consume
Destroy a card to gain gems.

. Discard the consumed card to the dead pile.
. Gain gems equal to the sum of all sectors controlled by the card's color.
. Secretly and simultaneously bid against collapse.
.. The threshold for collapse is equal to the total number of disks of that
   color in the galaxy, even if conquered.
.. Combine all the bids.
.. If the total is exactly equal to the threshold, pay it all to the bank and
   nothing else happens.
.. If it is less than the threshold, destroy a controlling disk of that color
   for each gem less (or as many as possible).
... The active player chooses in the case of a tie.
... Destroyed disks go to the highest bidder.
... If that's a tie, destroyed disks are removed from the game.
.. If more than enough gems were bid, pay the threshold value to the bank, and
   then the active player places the excess in any sector controlled by the
   consumed color.

.Consuming for gems and collapse.

== Scoring and Victory
Your cards and dead disks are each worth VPs equal to the total value
controlled by their color.  Gems in your bank also count directly for VP.

TIP: Consuming cards locks in their color's value and gives you more gems to
spend, but means you won't be able to score if it grows later.  It is best to
Consume a color at its peak.

=== Procedure
. Put any cards/disks worth zero away.
. For each color, determine who has the least cards/disks.
.. Have each player put that many of that color's cards/disks away.
. Count up the value of cards/disks that remain.
. Add your gems to that total for your final score.
.. In the case of a tie, the player with the most gems wins.

.Scoring
====
Blue controls three sectors valued 2, 3, and 5.
Red controls one sector valued at 0.
White controls a sector valued at 3.

Alice holds sixteen gems, three blue cards, a dead red disk, a white card and
a dead white disk.  Alice's blue cards score 30 VPs total (10 each), the red
disk scores nothing, and the white card and disk score 6 total.

Alice scores 52.
