A game for two to four immortals, plays in about 500 millenia (an hour).

[verse, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Ozymandias]
____
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
____

== Overview
_Rise_ is a science-fantasy 4x god game.

== Objective
Have the most influence at the end of the game.

Colors are worth influence equal to the value of all sectors they control.
Each card is worth influence equal to its color.

.Card influence.
====
I have two red cards.

Red controls three hexes with values two, one, and zero, so my cards are worth
three influence each: six influence total.
====

== Components
* This rulebook.
* A deck of event cards.
** Each color gets 13.
* A collection of influence tokens.
** Gems in the playtest copy; at least 80 1s and 40 5s.
** Alternatively, poker chips.
* 24 control disks, six in each of four colors.
** Initial four sets are white, black, blue, red.
* 22 hexagonal sector tiles.
** 2x 0s, 8x 1s, 6x 2s, 4x 3s, and 2x 4s.

== Setup
* Shuffle the sector tiles.
* Draw one sector and place it in the center of the table.
* Shuffle the deck.
* Draw three cards to make the *market*.
* Deal each player three cards and nine influence.
** Players may *one-time only* bury any number of cards to the bottom of the
   deck and draw that many cards, as a mulligan. Shuffle the deck after all
   players have had a chance to mulligan, if necessary.
* Decide which player is closest to immortality.  That player starts.

TIP: The previous winner is probably closest to immortality, should you need
assistance choosing.

== Parts of Play
The common play area is separated into the market and the galaxy. In addition,
each player has a hand and a discard pile.

=== Discard Piles
Players play cards to their discard pile, face up.  The top card of a player's
discard is always *active* and may be auctioned by any player on their turn.
Ensuring your active card provides a useful effect while you take other actions
is a cornerstone of efficient play.  When no cards are left in your hand at the
start of your turn, you may take your entire discard pile back into your hand.

=== The Market
Cards in the market can be put up for auction by players to expand the range of
powers wielded by the immortals.  At the end of each turn, if the market has
fewer than three cards: add cards from the deck until there are three.

=== The Galaxy
The galaxy is defined by hexagonal sectors. At the start of the game the
universe is void and without form. Only through exploration does the universe
take shape.

Each sector has a value determined by its natural resources (the value on the
sector) and its invested influence (the amount of influence placed on the
sector).  Only one color at a time may control a sector and it is the color
that is on top of the stack. A sector with no disks is *empty*.

.Sector control.
====
A sector contains a blue, white and red disk. Only the red disk, sitting on top
of the stack, has control of the sector.  The sector has an intrinsic value of
2 and an additional point of influence for a total value of 3. Red has a
value of 3 and all other colors have 0.
====

When disks are destroyed, the active player keeps them in their own personal
dead pool.

== Play
Play proceeds in turns.  At the beginning of your turn, if you have no cards
in your hand, take your discard pile into your hand.  Take one of the following
actions:

- Auction a market card or any active card.
- Play a card for expansion.
- Play a card for its event.
- Reap a card from your hand for influence.

If all disks have been placed or destroyed, *the game ends*.

=== Auction
Put a card up for auction, either from the market or any player's active card.
Place it in front of you, facing other players, during this process.  Everyone
secretly bids influence and simultaneously reveals their bids.

The high bidder takes the card and gives the bid to:

- If from the market: the active player (if the active player would pay
  themselves, they pay the bank instead).
- If from a player: the former owner as compensation (if the card's owner would
  pay themselves, they pay the active player instead).

Losing bidders keep their bids.

TIP: The auction is a good way to make some money, if you don't mind your
opponent getting a card.

Caveats:

- As always, the active player breaks all ties.
- If nobody bids anything, the card is buried on the bottom of the deck.

=== Expand
Play a card to place a disk and gain income.

1. Put the card on your discard pile.  It's now active and the previous top
   card, if any, is inactive.
2. Take a disk of its color and place it on a sector:
   - If the color doesn't control any sectors, place the disk in any empty
     sector, or draw and place a new sector (adjacent to an existing tile) for
     the disk.
   - If the color controls at least one sector, place the disk on or adjacent
     to one of the sectors that the color controls.  (Yes, you can place a disk
     on top of its own color.)
3. Gain influence equal to the sector's value.
4. If you drew a new sector, reveal and execute the top card of the deck.
   (Leave it on top afterwards.)

If you expand with a color that has no disks left in the pool, you place no
disk and get no bonus, but the card still becomes active on your discard pile.

CAUTION: Exploring is risky; income tends to be low, and many events have no
effect when revealed during exploration.

=== Event
Play a card to execute its event.

1. Put the card on your discard pile.  It's now active and the previous top
   card, if any, is inactive.
2. Follow its instructions.

Some event text begins with a *trigger*, such as:

- "At the beginning of your turn: ..."
- "When you buy this card: ..."
- "When you harvest this card: ..."

These cards may not be played for their event.  Their event automatically takes
place when the trigger condition happens.

IMPORTANT: If you place disks with an event, you don't gain influence nor
execute an event for exploring a sector.  The event is reward enough.

=== Reap
Sell a card for influence; place it in front of you sideways during this
process.

1. Determine the value of its color by counting up sector values.
2. Gain that much influence from the bank.
3. Bid for preservation of that color.
4. Bury the reaped card on the bottom of the deck.

==== Preservation

1. [Everyone] Secretly bid influence and simultaneously reveal your bid.
2. [Active player] Take all bids and spend them to preserve sectors:
   - Each gem spent preserves one sector.
   - If there aren't enough gems to preserve all the sectors, preserve the
     highest value ones first, and then destroy the top disk of the rest.
   - If there are more than enough gems, take the excess and place it in one
     preserved sector, increasing it's value.

.Preservation of blue
====
In a two-player game, blue controls two sectors (a 3-value and a 2-value) and
Alice sells a blue card, gaining 5 influence from the bank.

Alice bids nothing and Bob bids one influence to preserve blue.

Alice preserves the 3-value sector and destroys the blue disk on top of the
2-value sector.

== Game End
The game ends when all disks have been placed or destroyed.

=== Scoring
1. Determine the value of each color by counting up sector values.
2. For every card in your hand or discard pile gain points equal to the value
   of the color symbols on it.
3. Add the value of your influence.
4. The player with the highest combined card and influence value wins. In case
   of a tie the player with the most influence wins.

TIP: Count up the influence for each color and multiply.
