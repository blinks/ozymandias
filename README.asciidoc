== Introduction

[verse, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Ozymandias]
____
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
____

== Components
A complete set of _Rise_ includes:

* A deck of hexagonal sector tiles.
** Sectors start face-down in an _exploration_ pile, and are slowly added to
   the _galaxy map_ as players explore.  When destroyed, sectors are flipped
   face-down in-place.
** Each sector is considered controlled by a single color, or it is
   uncontrolled. A sector is considered controlled by a color if that colorâ€™s
   disk is on top of all other disks in the sector.
** http://printplaygames.com/product/die-cut-pieces-tiles-and-counters[P&P]:
   the 1.5" hex tiles, with three 0s and 4s, six 1s and 3s, and nine 2s.
* A deck of 56 cards.
** Cards start in a shuffled event _deck_, and are drawn out during
   exploration.
** Players have personal _discard_ piles (two each) that eventually get
   recovered into their hands.  A player's discard piles should be kept so each
   previous card's color is visible at all times.  The top card of both a
   player's discard piles are _active_, its icon showing when it will take
   effect.  When destroyed, cards are placed in a common _dead_ pile.
** The deck of cards represents archetypical historical events, the kind that
   get referenced in speech enough to become a stand-in for anything similar.
** Each card has a color of civilization that it influences, a title, and some
   rules text.
** http://www.printplaygames.com/product/blank-cards[P&P]: 14 each of black,
   white, blue, and red.
* 24 wooden empire disks.
** Empire disks start in a common _pool_ at the edge of the play area.  They're
   slowly moved onto the _galaxy map_ as players explore and conquer.  When
   disks are destroyed (or collapse), they're put back into the game box in a
   _dead_ pile. 
** From https://www.printplaygames.com/product/25mm-x-7mm-wood-discs[P&P]: 6
   each of black, blue, red, and white.
* Resource tokens in two denominations: 50 1s, 50 5s.
** Resources start in a collective _bank_.  Players gain and spend resources,
   and resources are worth points at the end of the game.  A player's current
   resources should be visible at all times, except when bidding.
** From http://www.printplaygames.com/product/acrylic-gem-10mm[P&P]: clear for
   1s and red for 5s.
* This rule book.

== Set Up
. Shuffle the sector tiles and deal three to the center of the table to make
  the initial galaxy map.  They should be arranged in a triangle, so each is
  adjacent to the other two.
. Shuffle the deck of cards and deal one to each player, face-down.  This is
  their starting hand.
. Give nine resources to each player to make their initial banks.
. Place the decks, disks and resource tokens at the side of the table.

== Game Sequence
On your turn, you must *Explore*, *Conquer*, or *Reap*.  Play then proceeds
clockwise to the next player.  The game is over when all disks are gone from
the pool and any single player is out of cards.

At any time (even when it isn't your turn), you may pay resources equal to the
number of cards left in your hand to recover one of your discard piles.

=== Explore
*Purpose*::
Discover new sectors and gain new cards.
*Procedure*::
. Choose an uncontrolled sector or draw and place a new one.  Place a disk of
  any color from the pool on it.  Ignore adjacency.
. Draw cards equal to the sector's value from the deck, and announce their
  colors, but keep the cards hidden.  Announce your bid for the pack of cards.
. Your opponents choose their bid secretly, and simultaneously reveal.  The
  high bidder gives you their bid and takes the cards into their hand.
** If you're the high bidder, pay your bid to the bank and take the cards.
** If there's a tie, you decide who wins the bid.
. Each player (starting with you) may resolve a triggered exploration effect on
  top of one of their discard piles.
** Exploration effects trigger if their color is in or adjacent to the explored
   sector.

.Explore example
====
TODO: first explore

TODO: a zero revealed

TODO: reshuffle?

TODO: no more sectors?
====

=== Conquer
*Purpose*:: Conquer a sector of the galaxy with a color in your hand.
*Procedure*::
. Discard a card, place a disk of that card's color on a sector tile.
.. Place the disk adjacent to a sector that color is already in (even if it
   doesn't control that sector).
.. If that color is nowhere in the galaxy, you may place it on any sector.
.. You may not place on a sector that color already controls.
. Gain resources equal to that sector's value less the number of disks you
  conquered.
. Each player (starting with you) may resolve a triggered conquer effect on
  top of one of their discard piles.
** Conquer effects may trigger if their color disk is in the conquered sector.

.Conquer example
====
TODO: if the last [color] disk is removed, future [color] events are canceled.
====

=== Reap
*Purpose*::
Destroy cards to gain resources.
*Procedure*::
. Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you, then each other player
  may do the same.
.. If timing matters, these decisions happen in play order.
. Simultaneously reveal, and take resources equal to the sum of all sectors
  controlled by your card's color.
.. Set these cards aside to remember what colors were reaped.
. Each player (starting with you) may resolve a triggered reap effect on
  top of one of their discard piles.
** Reap effects trigger if their color was reaped.
. Finally, if no effects prevent it, bid against collapse:
.. Count the total number of disks of all reaped colors in the galaxy, even if
   conquered -- this sum is the _Threshold_.
.. Each player secretly and simultaneously bids resources, then reveals.
.. If the total bid is at least the Threshold, pay all bids to the bank and end
   the turn. Otherwise, the difference is the number of disks to collapse:
.. The high bidder removes that many disks.
.. If tied, those players take turns removing disks in play order.
.. Destroy all reaped cards.

.Reap example
====
TODO: card value computation, especially taller stacks.

TODO: threshold computation, especially conquered colors.
====

== Endgame
When all disks are out of the pool, it becomes impossible to explore or
conquer: players must reap.  If all disks are out of the pool and any one
player cannot reap, the game ends.  The player with the most resources wins.

In the case of a tie, the player with the most cards left wins.  If still tied, the player who would take the next turn wins.
