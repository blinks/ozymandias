== Introduction

[verse, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Ozymandias]
____
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
____

== Components
A complete set of _Rise_ includes:

* 20 hexagonal sector tiles.
** Sectors start face-down in a pile, and are slowly added to the galaxy as
   players explore.
** Each sector is considered controlled by a single color, or it is
   uncontrolled. A sector is considered controlled by a color if that colorâ€™s
   disk is on top of all other disks in the sector.
** http://printplaygames.com/product/die-cut-pieces-tiles-and-counters[P&P]:
   the 1.5" hex tiles, with five 1s, eight 2s, five 3s, one 4, and one 5.
* A deck of 56 cards.
** The deck of cards represents archetypical historical events, the kind that
   get referenced in speech enough to become a stand-in for anything similar.
** Each card has a color of civilization that it influences, a title, and some
   rules text.
** http://www.printplaygames.com/product/blank-cards[P&P]: 14 each of black,
   white, blue, and red.
* 24 wooden empire disks.
** At the beginning of the game, these have yet to rise to any real place in
   the galaxy, and all sit in a pool at the side of the table. Players move
   them from the pool to the galaxy as empires expand. Players move them from
   the galaxy to the box as empires collapse.
** From https://www.printplaygames.com/product/25mm-x-7mm-wood-discs[P&P]: 6
   each of black, blue, red, and white.
* Resource tokens in two denominations: 50 1s, 50 5s.
** From http://www.printplaygames.com/product/acrylic-gem-10mm[P&P]: clear for
   1s and red for 5s.
* This rule book.

== Set Up
. Shuffle the sector tiles and the deck of cards, and place the disks and
  resource tokens in a common pool reachable by all players.
. Give nine resources to each player to make their initial banks.
. The last player to discover something is the first player.
.. (This player must explore.)

== Game Sequence
On your turn, you must *Explore*, *Conquer*, or *Reap*.  At the end of your
turn, if there are no disks left in the common pool, the game ends immediately.
Otherwise, play proceeds clockwise to the next player.

Before you take an action, you may pay resources equal to the number of cards
left in your hand to recover your discard pile.  Then take an action as normal.

=== Explore
*Purpose:* Discover new sectors and gain new cards.

*Primary Effect*
. Draw and place new sectors until there are three empty sectors.
. Deal three cards to each player and draft.
.. To draft, choose one card and pass the rest clockwise.
.. You may either take the chosen card into your hand or destroy it for
   resources equal to the highest-value uncontrolled sector.
.. When a card is destroyed, it goes into the common dead pile.
. Place a disk of any color on any empty sector.
.. This isn't a conquer: ignore normal placement rules.

*Secondary Effect*
. Each player must pay one resource for each card in their hand.
.. Players may destroy cards from their hand for one resource per card before
   paying this cost.
.. When a card is destroyed, it goes into the common dead pile.

.Explore example
====
TODO: first explore

TODO: no sectors revealed

TODO: reshuffle?

TODO: no more sectors?
====

=== Conquer
*Purpose:* Conquer a sector of the galaxy with a color in your hand.

*Primary Effect*
. Discard a card, place a disk of that card's color on a sector tile, and gain
  resources equal to that sector's value less the number of disks you
  conquered.
.. Place the disk adjacent to a sector that color is already in (even if it
   doesn't control that sector).
.. If that color is nowhere in the galaxy, you may place it on any sector.
.. You may not place on a sector that color already controls.

*Secondary Effect*
. Each player with a card matching a color in the sector you chose resolves it.
.. When order matters, start with you and proceed in play order.

.Conquer example
====
TODO: if the last [color] disk is removed, future [color] events are canceled.
====

=== Reap
*Purpose:* Destroy cards to gain resources.

*Primary Effect*
. Place a card from your hand face-down in front of you, then each other player
  may do the same.
.. If timing matters, these decisions happen in play order.
. Simultaneously reveal, and take resources equal to the sum of all sectors
  controlled by your card's color.
.. Set these cards aside to remember what colors were reaped.

*Secondary Effect*
. Count the total number of disks of all reaped colors in the galaxy, even if
  conquered -- this sum is the Threshold.
. Each player secretly and simultaneously bids resources, then reveals.
. If the total bid is at least the Threshold, pay all bids to the bank and end
  the turn. Otherwise, the difference is the number of disks to collapse:
.. The high bidder removes that many disks.
.. If tied, those players take turns removing disks in play order.
. Destroy all reaped cards.

.Reap example
====
TODO: card value computation, especially taller stacks.

TODO: threshold computation, especially conquered colors.
====

== Scoring and Victory
Your cards are each worth points equal to the total value controlled by their
color.  Resources in your bank also count directly for points.

TIP: Reaping cards locks in their color's value and gives you more resources to
spend, but means you won't be able to score if it grows later.  It is best to
Reap a color at its peak.

=== Procedure
. Count up the value of all your cards.
. Add your resources to that total for your final score.
.. In the case of a tie, the player with the most resources wins.
