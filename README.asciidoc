== Introduction

[verse, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Ozymandias]
____
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
____

_Rise_ is a 2- to 4-player board game depicting the life cycle of space-faring
civilizations over millennia.  Each player takes the role of a powerful
immortal seeking to have the most influence over humanity, whether benevolent
investment or malevolent destruction.

== Components
A complete set of _Rise_ includes:

* 22 hexagonal sector tiles.
* A deck of 52 cards, in four different colors.
* 24 black, blue, red, and white wooden disks.
* Power gems: white (1s) and red (5s).
* This rule book.

=== The Galaxy Map
The map is divided into hexagonal Sectors, each with a numeric value.  A sector
is a vast expanse of space arbitrarily reduced to a single number from zero to
four.

Each sector is considered Controlled by a single color, or it is uncontrolled.
A sector is considered Controlled by a color if that color's disk is on top of
all other disks in the sector.

.Sector control.
====
A sector with no disks on it is uncontrolled.

A sector with a single disk on it is controlled by that disk's color.

A sector with two or more disks on it is controlled by the top disk's color.
====

The stack of disks in a sector serves as a historical record of control in that
sector.  Civilizations that collapse reveal earlier disks, who retake control.

=== Cards
The deck of cards represents archetypical historical events, the kind that get
referenced in speech enough to become a stand-in for anything similar.  Each
card has a color of civilization that it influences, a title, and some rules
text.

.Sample card.
====
TODO: Insert a card image.
====

Cards may be played to Expand with their color.  Cards may also be Consumed to
gain Power.

Players place played cards on their own discard piles, recovering their discard
in its entirety when their hand is empty.  The top card of each player's
discard pile is active: its event will execute when its color is conquered, and
it will give its player income when that color conquers.

When a color explores (expands into) a newly-drawn sector, players bid for the
ability to expand the range of powers their immortal avatars wield. Purchased
cards will be placed in the high-bidder's hand after resolving their event (if
any).  When consumed, cards will be buried on the bottom of the deck.

=== Civilization Disks
Six wooden disks of each color represent archetypical civilizations.

At the beginning of the game, these have yet to rise to any real place in the
galaxy, and all sit in a pool at the side of the table.  Players move them from
the pool to the galaxy as civilizations expand.  Players take them from the
galaxy to their private banks as civilizations collapse.

A game of _Rise_ lasts only as long as there are disks in the common pool.  At
the end of the turn where the last civ is removed from the pool, the game ends.

== Set Up

. Place the disks in a common pool reachable by all players.
. Shuffle the deck and deal three cards to each player to make their initial
  hands.
.. Players may look at their hands.
. Give nine influence to each player (four white gems and one red gem) to make
  their initial banks.  Place the rest near the market.
. Shuffle the sector tiles and draw one to place in the middle of the playing
  area to make the initial explored sector.
. Deal face-up cards equal to the initial sector's value to make the initial
  exploration pool.

== Game Sequence

A turn in _Rise_ begins with Dawn, followed by your Action.  If you have no
cards left in your hand, you may recover your discard pile before taking your
Action.

NOTE: Dawn may be replaced with "once during your turn, you may..."

.Sustainable Farming
====
The card *Sustainable Farming* reads "Dawn: Gain two gems."

If this card is active (on top of your discard) when your turn begins, you gain
two gems before taking your action.  You only get two gems on your own turn.
====

At the end of your turn, if there are no disks left in the common pool, the
game ends.  Otherwise, play proceeds clockwise to the next player.

== Actions
There are several different actions you can take on your turn.  Each will move
a card from one place to another.  You may not forgo your turn by declining to
take an action, but you can choose to take an action that would have no effect.

.Null expansion.
====
All the red disks have been placed by previous actions.  You may choose to
Expand with a red card in your hand, even though this will not cause a new disk
to be placed.
====

* *Expand* a color's control with a card from your hand or the top of the deck.
* *Consume* a card from your hand for its value.

=== Expand
Activate a card from your hand or the deck to place a disk of its color.

. Reveal a card from your hand or the top of the deck.
.. From your hand goes to your discard pile at the end of your turn.
.. From the deck goes to the market immediately.
. Place a disk of its color.
.. If there are no disks of that color, your turn ends.
.. If that color controls any sectors, you must place it adjacent to one.
.. Otherwise, you may place it anywhere.

. *Explore* -- if you place in unexplored territory (with no sector tile):
.. Draw cards equal to the new tile's value for the market.
.. Secretly and simultaneously bid for control.
.. From the high-bidder down, players spend their bid to take a card:
... From the market to their hand: pay the active player, you resolve the
    event.
... From the top of a lower-bidding opponent's discard to their hand: pay that
    opponent, who then resolves the event.

. *Conquer* -- if you place in explored territory (with a sector tile):
.. Gain the tile's value in power.
.. Each player with the conquering color active gains the tile's value.
.. In play order, starting with you, each player with the conquered color
   active resolves their active event.

=== Consume
Bury a card to gain power.

. Place the consumed card on the table, sideways.
. Gain power equal to the sum of all sectors controlled by the card's color.
. Bid against Collapse of sectors this color controls:
.. Hide your power and take zero or more into your hand as your bid.
.. When you’ve chosen your bid, hold your fist over the playing area.
.. Once all players have chosen, reveal your bids by opening your fists.
.. Sum the total power bid. Each power preserves one sector controlled by the
   Consumed color, starting with the highest value sector and continuing down.
.. If there is not enough power to preserve all that color’s sectors, pay all
   the power to the bank and destroy that color's active disk in sectors not
   preserved. In case of a tie, the active player chooses which to destroy.
   As always, give destroyed disks to the active player.
.. If there is more than enough, pay the power used to preserve to the bank and
   place the rest in any one sector controlled by the consumed color. (The
   active player chooses.)
. Resolve any Consume effects.
. Bury the consumed card on the bottom of the deck.

.Consuming for power and collapse.

== Scoring and Victory
The object of the game is to score power.  Your cards and dead disks are each
worth power equal to the total value controlled by their color.  Power gems in
your bank also count towards your score.

TIP: Consuming cards locks in their color's value and gives you more power to
spend, but means you won't be able to score if it grows later.  It is best to
Consume a color at its peak.

.Scoring
====
Blue controls three sectors valued 2, 3, and 5.
Red controls one sector valued at 0.
White controls a sector valued at 3.

Alice holds sixteen power, three blue cards, a dead red disk, a white card and
a dead white disk.  Alice's blue cards score 30 power total (10 each), the red
disk scores nothing, and the white card and disk score 6 total.

Alice scores 52 power.
