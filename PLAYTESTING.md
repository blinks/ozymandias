# Playtesting
The master branch is tested, and the current pull request has all the changes
that are not yet tested.  Feel free to try either one, but make sure I know
which, if you report.

## Components
* Cards, available in the oracle directory. (Run `rake pnp`.)
  * I'll try and put a PDF in the releases section.
* Colonies, probably either poker chips or disks lying around. Anything
  stackable.
* Cash, either gems or poker chips or whatever.

I purchase my components from https://www.printplaygames.com/
