# Playtesting
The master branch is tested, and the current pull request has all the changes
that are not yet tested.  Feel free to try either one, but make sure I know
which, if you report.

## Components
* Some cool piece (I use an Icehouse pyramid) to mark first player.
* Cards, available in the oracle directory. (Run `rake pnp`.)
  * I'll try and put a PDF in the releases section.
* A set of 2.2‚Äù tri-hex sector tiles.
  * Assets coming with #36, but these are the most painful to get.
* A collection of resources in three colors (gold, red, blue).
* For each player [grey, green, blue, black?, brown, yellow, red]:
  * A set of four numbered (or otherwise labeled 15mm x 10mm cylinder) fleet
    pawns -- I draw the numbers on with permanent marker.
  * A set of eight colonies (colored 15mm x 4mm disks).
