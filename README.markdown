# Ozymandias
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> ’My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’  
> Nothing beside remains.  
> — Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

## Components
* A black obelisk (or something), to mark the first player in each age.
* A deck of 60 (poker-size) cards, for each suit (merchant, soldier, sage) and
  rank (2 to 6).
* A set of 9 (2.2” tri-hex) sector tiles, each with a suit (as above), an
  average of two colonizable locations and eight non-colonizable locations, and
  edges between locations.
* A collection of resource cubes (red strength, gold wealth, blue secrets).
* For each player:
  * A set of four numbered (or otherwise labeled 15mm x 10mm cylinder) fleet
    pawns.
  * A set of eight colonies (colored 15mm x 4mm disks).

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sector tiles.
2. Place one sector tile (two with four or more players) in the middle of the
   table.
3. Have each player choose a set of fleet pawns and colonies.
4. Give one player the obelisk -- they’ll take the first action.
5. Give each player five cards and one of each resource, then each player may
   take one additional resource of any type.

## Game Sequence
Ozymandias is played in a sequence of ages.  Each age consists of three parts:
planning, execution, and regroup.  The planning stage happens simultaneously,
as each player decides what they want to do.  Execution rolls those plans out
one action at a time.  At the end of the age is all the cleanup and some card
draw.

### Planning
Place one card face-down (portrait) on any fleet, as a leader.  This card's
ability will be revealed when that fleet is involved in any action, and will be
connected to that fleet until it dies.  If you give a fleet a second (or third,
etc.) leader, it must either cover up the most recent leader's ability or suit.

Place up to one card face-down (landscape) below each fleet, for income.  This
card's suit determines the type of resource it will gather, and the rank
determines the amount it will gather.  After gathering income, you'll give this
card to an opponent.

* A merchant card gathers wealth, which is spent to move.
* A soldier card gathers strength, which is spent to colonize and reinforce.
* A sage card gathers secrets, which is spent to alter cards.
* A secret may always be spent when you reveal a card to change its suit to
  whatever you want.

### Execution
Take turns activating a fleet or passing until all players have passed in
sequence.

#### Commission a new fleet
Each age you'll be able to build one new fleet.  In the first age, this is
fleet 1, fleet 2 in the second, and so on.  If you have not yet built your
fleet, you may not pass.  To build a fleet, place its pawn on any unoccupied
location.  If this fleet has an unrevealed leader, reveal it now.

#### Gather resources
Reveal the face-down card to gather resources equal to its rank.  Then give that
card to an opponent.

 * Merchants gather wealth.
 * Soldiers gather strength.
 * Sages gather secrets.

#### Move
Pay wealth based on how many times this fleet has moved this age.  If this is
its first movement, pay 1.  Second movement, pay 2.  Third movement, pay 3.  A
fleet may not be activated to move more than three times per age.  Track this
count by leaving wealth spent to move on the fleet leader.

When activated, a fleet moves up to three links.  One movement may be spent to
skirmish an adjacent fleet -- but a skirmish ends movement.  Fleets may not move
through other fleets, even if friendly.

* Exploration: If you move a fleet off the edge of a sector, it's safe, but you
  may no longer activate it to move.  When a sector is connected to the edge you
  left, place your fleet on the new location connected to that edge.  (At the
  end of the age, new sectors will be revealed.)
* Colonization: If you move a fleet _off_ a colony location, pay strength equal
  to one plus the number of colonies already there to place your own colony
  (from anywhere, normally off-board).  If you already have a colony in that
  location, pay the strength to move that one to the top instead.

#### Move: Skirmish
Choose an adjacent enemy fleet to skirmish.  Players will add strength to their
fleets, then play cards until one decides to retreat and take losses.

##### Reinforcement
Both players simultaneously reveal any amount of strength to reinforce their
fleets. This strength is then placed with the fleet leader(s), and can’t be
moved later.  (Important: fleets have a maximum strength of six.  Reinforcements
revealed in excess of six are lost.)

##### Initiative Rounds
The weaker fleet (or active player, if tied) has the starting initiative.  The
player with initiative may either play a card in the suit matching their
fleet’s sector (or non-matching suit and a secret), or retreat.

* Play a card: Add the card’s rank [temporarily] to your fleet’s strength and
  repeat.  (If you’re now tied or stronger, the opponent takes initiative.)
* Retreat.

##### Retreat
If tied, the skirmish ends and nothing else happens.  Otherwise, you lose
strength and/or leaders from the fleet equal to the margin of victory, then the
winner moves your fleet that same number of links.  If you move _past_ one of
your own colonies, the winner may place their own colony on top of it for free.

#### Pass
Pass your turn.  You may not pass if any fleet still has a card face-down for
income, or you haven't warped in your new fleet for this age.

*Passive income:* When you pass, gain a resource for each of your visible leader
suits.

If all players pass in a row, move on to regroup.  Otherwise, passing doesn’t
mean you can’t act the next time your turn is up.

### Regroup
Give the obelisk to the next active player (who should also have been the first
player to pass in a row).  They will act first, next age.  In this way, players
will never be skipped in the turn order from one age to the next.

*Exploration:* In turn order, each player draws sectors for each of their
exploring fleets to land on.  Draw in fleet order if you have multiple exploring
fleets.  If you can't place a sector on a fleet, you may place that fleet
anywhere.

*Draw:* In turn order, each player may pay 0, 1, 3, or 6 secrets to draw 2, 3,
4, or 5 cards.

*Endgame:* If any player has placed all their colonies, check for victory.  If
no victory, continue the next age with planning.

## Victory
At the end of an age where at least one player has placed all their colonies,
the player with the most ruling colonies (those on top of a colony stack) wins.
If this is a tie, the game continues.

## Inspiration
* Friedrich and Maria for the skirmish system.
* 7 Ages for the action plotting system and [kinda] trade mechanism.
* Glory to Rome for cards as either simple actions or complex static effects.
* Cosmic Encounter for crazy powers and “last colony ends it”.
* Race for the Galaxy for a tableau of powers triggered by actions.

## Cards
Deck of sixty cards in three suits and ranks two through six -- four sets of
fifteen, so that every suit and rank combination is represented evenly.  Every
card has a unique ability, card art, and name.
