# Ozymandias
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> ’My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’  
> Nothing beside remains.  
> — Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

Ozymandias is a card game for two to four players, gods overseeing the rise and
fall of galactic empires. Each uses their hand of cards to ensure that the
right empires are rising, and balances the short-term gain of war with the
long-term gain of cultivating growth.

Players don't control specific factions, they only hold some influence over
that faction based on the cards in their hand. Each faction can swing from one
player to another to another over the course of the game. In fact, you likely
won't know exactly who's winning the war of influence until the end, when cards
are revealed.

## Components
- ~16 Sector cards.
- ~12 Myth cards, ~6 cities, and a history marker for each faction.
- A history track card (6, 8, ..., 24, 26, 30).
- Influence tokens in several denominations.

### Sectors [Landscape]
Each sector has an exponent, from 1 to ~6. Lower numbers make placement harder,
higher numbers make it easier. Sectors also have a title and sometimes rules
text.

### Myths [Portrait]
Each myth has a faction and an exponent, from 1 to ~6. Lower numbers are better
for expansion, higher numbers are better for war. Myths also have a title and
sometimes rules text.

### Cities [Disks]
Cities are represented by colored wooden disks, and are stacked between sectors
so that each city can be adjacent to at most two sectors and the edge of each
sector can have at most one stack of cities. When stacked, the city on top is
the _ruling_ city, and that city's faction is the _ruling_ faction.

## Setup
1. Put each faction's history marker on the track at 6.
2. Set the faction cities and influence tokens aside.
3. Put the core sector (6) in the middle of the table.
4. Shuffle up the remaining cards and deal out hands of seven to each player.
5. Choose a starting player at random.
6. Give each player influence: the starting player 6, then 8, 10, 12 around the table.

## Play
Players take turns until at least one faction has reached the end of the
history track, and then score their influence and cards in their vault.

On a turn, choose one:

- Explore a sector.
- Build a city.
- Fight a war.

### Explore a sector
Place it on the map, adjacent to at least one city.

Choose a ruling faction next to your new sector and gain influence equal to its
place on the history track.

Take cards off the top of the deck equal to the sector's value and buy one,
putting the rest into the common discard. (See "buy a card", below.)

### Build a city
Play a card to your discard and take a city of its faction from off-board. If
no cities of that faction remain, you cannot take this action.

Place that city at the edge of a sector, or between two sectors. The lowest
adjacent sector exponent must be at least equal to the card's exponent. You may
place on top of other factions' cities -- only one stack of cities may be
between any two sectors.

For each city in the stack, all players gain influence equal to the number of
cities remaining for that faction for each matching card in their discard. That
is, if you place a white city, leaving four unplaced, and I have two white
cards, I get four influence for each card, giving me eight.

### Fight a War
Pick up your discards and choose a sector. (If that sector has an event,
resolve it now.)

Each player may contribute at most one card from their hand to the conflict,
matching a faction at that sector (no matter where it is in its stack).
Simultaneously reveal cards and add their exponents to the number of matching
ruling cities. If no cards were played, the turn is over.

The faction(s) with the highest total win the war. All non-winning cities are
destroyed, and the winning faction(s) get +1 on the history track for each
destroyed city. If no cities were destroyed, winning faction(s) still get +1 on
the history track.

Contributed cards that match a winning faction get placed face-down in their
player's vault, to be scored for faction value at the end of the game. Players
who scored a card in this way then must buy cards (in turn order, starting with
the active player) for each card they put into their vault.

#### Buy a Card
Pay influence to take a card from the top of the deck or the discard pile and
put it into your hand.

- From the deck, purchase sight-unseen at the second-highest faction's value on
  the history track.
- From _anywhere_ in the discard pile, purchase a sector at twice the number of
  sectors on the map, or a myth at the faction's value on the history track.

If you must buy a card but don't have enough money to do so, the game ends and
you lose. Be careful if you're low on influence.

## Game End and Victory
When a faction hits the end of the history track, the game ends at the end of
that turn.

Players convert cards in their vaults into influence, then the player with the
most influence wins. In the case of a tie, the tied player who would take the
next turn wins.
