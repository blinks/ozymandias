Ozymandias is a game for two to six players ruling galaxy-spanning
civilizations.

(See PLAYTESTING.md for print-and-play information.)

## Components
- A collection of faction cubes and unrest cubes.
- A deck of cards.
- A set of sector tiles.
- For each player, a set of twelve workers.

### The Cards
Each card has a suit and a rank, which determines their value in war.  They
also have rules text, which is active while in your tableau.

### The Sectors
Each sector has a suit, reflected in the symbol used for one to three
colonies on the sector, along with the color of the border around the
outside.

Sectors have lines running through them as well.  These are the paths you
follow when placing new workers on the map.  Workers are only placed on
intersections, colonies, or hazards (the black dots).  All these points are
on exactly one sector -- the suit you place in is important for war.

The colonies on a sector can be occupied by multiple players.  When a player
successfully conquers a colony, they place a worker on top of any already
there.  Every other player with a colony under that one gains unrest.

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sector tiles.
2. Place one sector tile in the middle of the table.
3. Have each player choose a set of workers: start with three and leave the
   rest in the bag.
4. Deal each player five cards and one of each faction cube: the cards go
   into your hand (you can look at them) and the cubes go on your left.
5. Choose a first player randomly.

## Game Sequence
Play proceeds in turns.  Each turn you choose one of three possible modes:

### Intake
Take all the incoming faction cubes from your left, and distribute to your
cards as you like (though each card has a preferred faction).  Anything you
don't distribute must continue on to the player on your right.

If you have any tapped cards in your tableau, discard them (cards with both
workers and enough faction cubes also score VPs).  For each card you discard,
recover a colony worker.  Then, tap any cards that have no faction cubes on
them.

Draw back up to five cards.

### Migration
Starting with the right-most card in your tableau, pick up all the cubes on
each card and move them right-wards, potentially to the previous player's
intake.  You may not leave cubes on a card.  For each color you give to the
player on your right, return an unrest cube.

Recover any or all of your _standing_ workers (not colonies or
newly-recruited workers).

### Campaign
Place as many workers as you like to take actions as described below.

You may stand a worker on the map, adjacent to an existing colony of yours.
If there's an enemy worker there, fight a war for control of that location,
with the loser taking back their worker.

You may lay a worker down on a colony, adjacent to another worker of yours, 
or on any colony if you have no workers on the map.  If there's an enemy
colony there, fight a war for control of that location, with the winner
sitting on top.  Either way, play a card to your tableau and add a cube of
its suit to your left.

You may put a worker at an unworked, untapped card in your tableau to lay a
worker down on that card.  You'll recover it when that card collapses.  At
most one worker can be laid-down on each card.

You may put a worker at an unworked, tapped card in your tableau to mark it
for harvest.  You'll score it the next time you do intake, if there's enough
faction cubes on it.

## Collapse
Tapped cards collapse on intake.  If there was a (standing) worker there, and
at least as many faction cubes as the card's rank (reduced by unrest), you'll
get to score points.

Count up the faction cubes that match the card's suit, limited by it's rank
less your unrest: score 1/3/6/10/15 points for 1/2/3/4/5+ matching cubes.  If
that card also has a new (laid-down) worker on it, score the next higher
level.

## War
Wars are resolved in one target location.  Everyone in that location gains
unrest, then the two warring players play a card face-down and simultaneously
reveal.

Double the rank of a card that matches the sector's suit, and then the high
card wins.  Active player wins ties.

In the unlikely case that a player has no cards, the other player wins the
war without playing a card.  (Everyone still gains unrest.)

## Victory
When a player reaches 21 VPs, each other player gets one more turn.  (That
player could get another turn, but it's not possible to get more points,
iiuc.)
