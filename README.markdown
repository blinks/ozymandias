# Ozymandias
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> ’My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’  
> Nothing beside remains.  
> — Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

Ozymandias is a card game for two to five players, gods overseeing the rise and
fall of galactic empires. Players don't control specific factions, they only
hold some influence over that faction based on the cards in their hand.

## Components
- A bunch of hexagonal sector tiles.
- A bunch of Myth cards and cities for each faction.
- Victory point tokens in several denominations.

### Sectors
Each sector has one of three symbols on it: square, triangle, or circle.

Abilities can use these symbols for effect.

### Myths
Each myth has a suit (faction color) and rank (1 to 6), along with a title and
rules text for its ability.

### Cities [Disks]
Cities are represented by colored wooden disks, and are stacked on the corners
of sectors so that each city can be adjacent to three sectors and each edge of
each sector can have at most one stack of cities on one of its two corners.

When stacked, the city on top is the _ruling_ city, and that city's faction is
the _ruling_ faction. Sectors a stack touches are _influenced_ by the ruling
faction.

## Setup
1. Set the faction cities and victory tokens aside.
2. Put the core sector (with no symbol) in the middle of the table.
3. Shuffle up the remaining cards and deal out hands of seven to each player.
4. Choose a starting player at random.

## Play
Players take turns until the deck runs out. At that point, the player with the
most victory points wins.

On a turn, take two actions. Each action may be one of the following:

- Explore: Place a sector and play an ability.
- Conquer: Discard a card and place a city disk.
- Harvest: War in a sector and sell cards.

Then everyone with less than seven cards in their hand and tableau combined
draws enough cards from the deck to bring them up to seven.

### Explore
Flip a sector and place it on the map, influenced by one or more factions. Then
play a card from your hand to your tableau, matching one of those factions.

Card abilities are based on triggers. Three common triggers are:

- A certain faction conquers (their city is placed).
- A certain faction is conquered (a city is placed on their stack).
- A certain rank is played in combat by the ability's controller.

### Conquer
Discard a card from your hand and place a city on the map, trigger abilities,
then draw a card.

- If that faction is already on the map, you can only place on a sector already
  influenced by it.  Otherwise, you may place on any sector.
- You may _not_ place the city on a stack equal or greater than your discarded
  card's rank.

### Harvest
Choose a sector influenced by at least one faction.

*Fighting:* Each player chooses a card from their hand to place face-down, and
then simultaneously reveals it. Abilities trigger. The highest rank wins the
sector for its card's faction, and all other factions on that sector are
destroyed.

*Reaping:* Then each revealed card is traded for victory points equal to the
number of sectors influenced by that faction, and players draw back to seven
cards.

## Game End and Victory
When the last card is drawn from the deck, the game ends.

The player with the most victory points wins.
