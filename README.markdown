# Ozymandias
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> ’My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’  
> Nothing beside remains.  
> — Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

## Components
* A black obelisk (or something), to mark the first player in each age.
* A deck of 60 (poker-size) cards, for each suit (merchant, soldier, sage) and rank (2 to 6).
* A set of 9 (2.2” tri-hex) sector tiles, each with a suit (as above), an average of two colonizable locations and eight non-colonizable locations, and edges between locations.
* A collection of resource cubes (red strength, gold wealth, blue secrets).
* For each player:
  * A set of four numbered (or otherwise labeled 15mm x 10mm cylinder) fleet pawns.
  * A set of eight colonies (colored 15mm x 4mm disks).

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sector tiles.
2. Place one sector tile (two with four or more players) in the middle of the table.
3. Have each player choose a set of fleet pawns and colonies.
4. Give one player the obelisk -- they’ll take the first action.
5. Give each player five cards.

## Game Sequence
Ozymandias is played in a sequence of ages.  Each age consists of three parts: planning, execution, and regroup.  The planning stage happens simultaneously, as each player decides what they want to do.  Execution rolls those plans out one action at a time.  At the end of the age is all the cleanup and some card draw.

### Planning
Place one card face-down (portrait) on any fleet, as a leader.  This card's ability will be revealed when that fleet is involved in any action, and will be connected to that fleet until it dies.  If you give a fleet a second (or third, etc.) leader, it must either cover up the most recent leader's ability or suit.

Place any number of cards face-down (landscape) under each fleet.  These cards can be revealed to take special actions during the age (primarily for collecting resources).  Each player always has a harvest special action, and leaders will enable other special actions.

* A merchant card gathers wealth, which is spent to move.
* A soldier card gathers strength, which is spent to colonize and reinforce.
* A sage card gathers secrets, which is spent to alter and draw cards.
* A secret may always be spent when you reveal a card to change its suit to whatever you want.

### Execution
Take turns activating a fleet or passing until all players have passed in sequence.

#### Fleet Construction
In every age you'll build one new fleet.  In the first age, this is fleet 1, fleet 2 in the second, and so on.  If you have not yet built your fleet, you may not pass.  To build a fleet, place its pawn on any unoccupied location.  If this fleet has an unrevealed leader, reveal it now.

#### Fleet Movement
Pay one wealth to give an activated fleet three movement points (MPs).

* *Travel:* Spend one MP to move a fleet to a connected, unoccupied location.
* *Colonization:* Spend one MP and strength equal to the number of colonies + 1 on a habitable location to conquer it.  
* *Exploration:* Spend all remaining MPs to move a fleet into the void -- leave it on the edge of the sector tile.
* *Skirmish:* Spend all remaining MPs to skirmish a fleet on a connected location.

#### Special Action: Harvest
Reveal a face-down card to gain resources equal to its rank.  Then give that card to an opponent.

 * Merchants gather wealth.
 * Soldiers gather strength.
 * Sages gather secrets.

#### Pass
Lose all remaining strength and wealth and pass your turn.  If you were the first player to pass, take the obelisk (first player marker).  You may not pass if you haven't built your new fleet for this age.  Once all players have passed, continue to the regroup phase.

*Passive Income:* If your turn comes back up and you've already passed, gain one resource for each leader you have, based on that leader's suit.

### Regroup
Clean up for the age in three steps.

1. *Exploration:* In turn order, each player draws sectors for each of their exploring fleets to land on.  Draw in fleet order if you have multiple exploring fleets.  If you can't place a sector on a fleet, you may place that fleet anywhere.
2. *Draw:* In turn order, each player may pay 0, 1, 3, or 6 secrets to draw 2, 3, 4, or 5 cards.
3. *Endgame:* If any player has placed all their colonies, check for victory.  If no victory, continue the next age with planning.

## Victory
At the end of an age where at least one player has placed all their colonies, the player with the most ruling colonies (those on top of a colony stack) wins. If this is a tie, the game continues.

## Skirmish
Players will add strength to their fleets, then play cards until one decides to retreat and take losses.

### Reinforcement
Both players simultaneously reveal any amount of strength to reinforce their fleets. This strength is then placed with the fleet leader(s), and can’t be moved later.  (Important: fleets have a maximum strength of six.  Reinforcements revealed in excess of six are lost.)

### Initiative Rounds
The weaker fleet (or active player, if tied) has the starting initiative.  The player with initiative may either play a card or retreat.

#### Card Play
Play a card in the suit matching their fleet’s sector (or non-matching suit and a secret). Add the card’s rank [temporarily] to your fleet’s strength and continue initiative rounds.  (If you’re now tied or stronger, the opponent takes initiative.)

#### Retreat
If tied, the skirmish ends and nothing else happens.  Otherwise, you lose strength and/or leaders from the fleet equal to the margin of victory, then the winner moves your fleet that same number of links.  If you move _past_ one of your own colonies, the winner may place their own colony on top of it for free.

## Inspiration
* Friedrich and Maria for the skirmish system.
* 7 Ages for the action plotting system and [kinda] trade mechanism.
* Glory to Rome for cards as either simple actions or complex static effects.
* Cosmic Encounter for crazy powers and “last colony ends it”.
* Race for the Galaxy for a tableau of powers triggered by actions.

## Cards
Deck of sixty cards in three suits and ranks two through six -- four sets of fifteen, so that every suit and rank combination is represented evenly.  Every card has a unique ability, card art, and name.
