# Ozymandias
> And on the pedestal these words appear: \\
> ’My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: \\
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’ \\
> Nothing beside remains. \\
> — Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

## Components
* A black obelisk (or something), to mark the first player in each age.
* A deck of 60 (poker-size) cards, for each suit (merchant, soldier, sage) and
  rank (2 to 6).
* A set of 9 (2.2” tri-hex) sector tiles, each with a suit (as above), an
  average of two colonizable locations and eight non-colonizable locations, and
  edges between locations.
* A collection of resource cubes (red strength, gold wealth, blue secrets).
* For each player:
  * A set of four numbered (or otherwise labeled 15mm x 10mm cylinder) fleet
    pawns.
  * A set of eight colonies (colored 15mm x 4mm disks).

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sector tiles.
2. Place one sector tile (two with four or more players) in the middle of the
   table.
3. Have each player choose a set of fleet pawns and colonies.
4. Give each player five cards, five strength, and one secret.
5. Give one player the obelisk -- they’ll take the first action.

## Game Sequence
Ozymandias is played in a sequence of ages.  Each age consists of three parts:
planning, execution, and regroup.  The planning stage happens simultaneously,
as each player decides what they want to do.  Execution rolls those plans out
one action at a time.  At the end of the age players draw a fixed income of
cards in regroup.

### Planning
Place up to one card face-down on each fleet leader, plus up to one on an empty
slot.  Except for forming a new fleet, movement, and skirmishing, a fleet’s
action is determined by what suit you placed.

* Any card in an empty slot forms a new fleet.
* A merchant card allows that fleet to trade for wealth, which is spent to
  move.
* A soldier card allows that fleet to recruit strength, which is spent to
  colonize and reinforce.
* A sage card allows that fleet to gain secrets, which is spent to change card
  suits.
* Movement and skirmishing may be performed whether or not you place a card.
* A secret may always be spent when you reveal a card to change its suit to
  whatever you want.

Note that new fleets cannot be given an order besides movement on their first
turn.

### Execution
Take turns choosing a fleet and executing an order until all players have
passed in sequence.

#### Commission a new fleet
Reveal the chosen card as the new fleet leader and place the pawn for that slot
in an unoccupied location that isn’t on or adjacent to an enemy fleet.

#### Trade (gain wealth)
Reveal the face-down merchant card (or non-merchant and a secret).  Choose an
opponent’s colony or fleet that your activated fleet can reach by movement as
your trade target.  Give the card to that opponent and gain wealth equal to its
value.

#### Recruit (gain strength)
Reveal the face-down soldier card (or non-soldier and a secret).  Gain strength
equal to its value and discard it.  (Note: Do not place this strength with a
fleet yet, that happens during a Skirmish.)

#### Observe (gain secrets)
Reveal and discard the face-down sage card (or non-sage and a secret).  Draw
two cards.  Reveal one of those cards and gain secrets equal to its rank.

#### Move
Pay one wealth (or discard one card from your hand) to activate one of your
fleets for movement.  When activated, a fleet moves up to three links.  One
movement may be spent to skirmish an adjacent fleet.  Fleets may not move
through other fleets, even if friendly.

* Skirmish Lock: Fleets may not be moved away if starting adjacent to an enemy
  fleet.
* Exploration: If you move a fleet off the edge of a sector, spend the rest of
  your movement to draw a new sector.  At the beginning of your next turn,
  place the sector and move your fleet onto it.
* Colonization: If you move a fleet off a colony location, pay strength equal
  to one plus the number of colonies already there to place your own colony
  (from anywhere, normally off-board).  If you already have a colony in that
  location, pay the strength to move that one to the top instead.

#### Move: Skirmish
Choose an adjacent enemy fleet to skirmish.  Players will add strength to their
fleets, then play cards until one decides to retreat and take losses.  Place a
marker where the skirmish is taking place, if necessary to remember it.

##### Reinforcement
Both players simultaneously reveal any amount of strength to reinforce their
fleets. This strength is then placed with the fleet leader, and can’t be moved
later.  Important: fleets have a maximum strength of six.  If a fleet has no
strength after reinforcement, skip to retreat (a player can’t play cards to
help a fleet at zero strength).

##### Initiative Rounds
The weaker fleet (or active player, if tied) has the starting initiative.  The
player with initiative may either play a card in the suit matching their
fleet’s sector (or non-matching suit and a secret), or retreat.

* Play a card: Add the card’s rank [temporarily] to your fleet’s strength and
  repeat.  (If you’re now tied or stronger, the opponent takes initiative.)
* Retreat: Lose fleet strength equal to the current margin (this could be
  zero), and then the winner moves the loser’s fleet one link per strength
  lost, away from the winning fleet.

##### Resolution
If either fleet now has no strength, remove it and discard the leader OR
destroy the closest friendly colony (even if subjugated -- that is, not the top
colony) to preserve the fleet token and leader.

#### Pass
Pass your turn.  If all players pass in a row, move on to regroup.  Otherwise,
passing doesn’t mean you can’t act the next time your turn is up.

### Regroup
Give the obelisk to the next active player (who should also have been the first
player to pass in a row).  They will act first, next age.  In this way, players
will never be skipped in the turn order from one age to the next.  Then, each
player draws three cards.  If any player has placed all their colonies, check
for victory.  If no victory, continue the next age with planning.

## Victory
At the end of an age where at least one player has placed all their colonies,
the player with the most ruling colonies (those on top of a colony stack) wins.
If this is a tie, the game continues.

## Inspiration
* Friedrich and Maria for the skirmish system.
* 7 Ages for the action plotting system and [kinda] trade mechanism.
* Glory to Rome for cards as either simple actions or complex static effects.
* Cosmic Encounter for crazy powers and “last colony ends it”.
* Race for the Galaxy for a tableau of powers triggered by actions.

## Cards
Deck of sixty cards in three suits and ranks two through six -- four sets of
fifteen, so that every suit and rank combination is represented evenly.  Every
card has a unique ability, card art, and name.

* More complex (and generally powerful) abilities are on the higher ranks.
* Card abilities have a timing word (kind of like a card type) and either a
  trigger or a cost for activation.
* Timing is one of the actions that a fleet can perform, or pass.
* Cards do not tap, nor do they reference the abilities of other cards in the
  deck.
* The only tokens cards can use are colonies, the three resources, or cards
  (w/o referencing ability).
* Suits determine the general type of ability, as a shortcut.
