Ozymandias is a game for two to six players ruling galaxy-spanning
civilizations.

(See PLAYTESTING.md for print-and-play information.)

## Components
- A collection of factions [cubes / gems] in three colors.
- A deck of cards.
- A set of sectors [hex tiles].
- A set of six colony disks for each player.

### The Cards
Each card has a suit and a rank, which determines their value in war and
their faction cap.  They also have a golden age ability and [potentially] an
ability in war.

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sectors.
2. Place three random sectors in the middle of the table.
3. Give each player six colonies of one color.
4. Deal each player a five card hand.
5. Give each player one of each faction.
6. Choose a first player at random.

## Game Sequence
Play proceeds in turns.  Each turn you choose to either rise or fall.

### Rise
Play a card to your tableau and place your colony on a sector adjacent to
where you already have one.  (If you have no cards in hand, or you have no
spare colonies, you cannot choose to rise.)

- Exploration: You may draw a new sector if you have a colony adjacent to the
  edge of the board, but you must place on that sector.
- War: If you place on an occupied sector, everyone in that sector must
  choose and then simultaneously reveal a card.  Resolve card abilities in
  turn order.  Double the rank of cards matching the sector's suit, and
  re-stack the colonies from high to low.  Tied players maintain the same
  order in the stack.

Whoever controls that sector (after any warfare is resolved) gains a faction
of its suit onto any card.

If you won a war, you may take another turn.

### Fall
Collapse golden age colonies and move factions counter-clockwise.

While you have cards in a golden age:
1. Choose a sector you control and destroy all the colonies there.
   (Destroyed colonies return to their owners.)
2. Take a faction of that sector's color from each opponent with a destroyed
   colony and place them on your own cards, ignoring golden age limits.
   (This is the only time you may over-stack.)
3. You and each other player with a destroyed colony, score and discard:
   - All players must choose golden age cards if possible.
   - Cards score based on the number of matching factions they hold:
     1/2/3/5/8/13 for 1/2/3/4/5/6+ matching factions.
   - All factions on discarded cards are passed to the right.

Migrate your factions rightwards:
- Incoming factions from the left _must_ be placed on cards or passed right.
- Existing factions on your cards _may_ be moved as desired.
- At least one faction _must_ move at least one card to the right.
- Cards _may not_ hold more factions than their rank.
- Cards with factions equal to their rank are in a golden age -- tap them to
  make that obvious.

Draw three(?) cards.

## Victory
When a player reaches 21 VPs, each other player gets one more turn.
