Ozymandias is a game for two to four players.

(See PLAYTESTING.md for print-and-play information.)

## Components
- A collection of faction disks in four colors.
- A deck of cards.
- A set of sectors [hex tiles].

### The Cards
Each card has a suit and a unique rank, which determines the faction they're
associated with and their order of play.

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sectors.
2. Place three random sectors in the middle of the table.
3. Deal each player a three card hand.
4. Deal a five-card market near the map.

## Game Sequence
The game is played in rounds, where each round players will play a card, place
a disk, trade a card, and potentially destroy an empire.

### Secret plans
Players secretly choose a card from their hand, and simultaneously reveal.
This card will be used for initiative this turn (based on the card's rank), and
to determine what empire this player will raise up.

### Raise empires, use abilities
From the lowest card to the highest, each player _either_ expands with their
card's faction _or_ executes their card's event.

When you expand, you place a disk of your card's color.  If that color already
has a disk in play, your disk must be adjacent to another of that color.  Otherwise, you can place anywhere.

When you use the event, follow its instructions.  If it disagrees with any of
the rules text, the card wins.

### Trade cards, score points
Then, from highest card to lowest, each player _must_ trade a card from their
hand for a card in the market, and _may_ trade the card they used this turn as
well.

When you trade, you score VPs equal to the difference in faction value, if
positive.  For example, if red controls three sectors and blue controls one,
you'd score two points when trading a red card for a blue card.  You'd score no
points for trading a blue card for a red card, but you also wouldn't lose any
points.

You may also trade for the top card of the deck, but you don't score any points
(you don't reveal the card you gained) and your traded card is put into the
discard pile instead of the market.

### Collapse an empire, refresh the market
If any color has the most cards in the market after all trades are complete,
all its top disks are destroyed.  Disks below the top disk are unharmed.  If
two colors are tied for the most, neither is destroyed.

Finally, discard the market and deal out five new cards.  Everyone recovers the
card they played this round (unless they sold it), and you all should begin the
next round with three cards in hand.
