# Ozymandias
> And on the pedestal these words appear:  
> ’My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’  
> Nothing beside remains.  
> — Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

## Components
* A black obelisk to mark the first player in each age.
* A deck of cards in three suits (merchant, soldier, sage).
* Sector tiles for the modular galaxy map.
* A collection of resource cubes (red strength, gold wealth, blue secrets).
* For each player:
  * A set of four fleet pawns.
  * A set of eight colonies.

## Game Setup
1. Shuffle the cards and sector tiles.
2. Place one sector tile in the middle of the table.
3. Have each player choose a set of fleet pawns and colonies.
4. Give one player the obelisk -- they’ll take the first action.
5. Give each player seven cards and one of each resource.

## Game Sequence
Ozymandias is played in a sequence of ages.  Each age consists of three parts: planning, execution, and regroup.  The planning stage happens simultaneously, as each player decides what they want to do.  Execution rolls those plans out one activation at a time.  At the end of the age is all the cleanup and some card draw.

### Planning
Choose one card as your new leader for this age.  This card's ability will be revealed when this age's fleet is placed, and will be connected to that fleet for the rest of the game.

Place any number of cards face-down (landscape) under each fleet.  These cards can be revealed to power abilities during the age (in particular, collecting resources).

### Execution
Take turns activating a fleet or passing until all players have passed.  Most actions can be taken at any time, but some require an active fleet or movement points, which restricts them to your turn.

To activate a fleet, pay wealth determined by how many times that fleet has been activated this age.  The first activation costs one wealth, the second two, the third three.  A fleet may not be activated more than three times in one age.  In the first age, you may only activate fleet 1.  In the second age, you may also activate fleet 2, and so on.

When you activate a fleet, it gains three movement points (MPs), which last until either spent or the end of your activation.

#### Abilities: Movement
* *Warp:* 1 MP: if the active fleet is on your player board, warp the active fleet onto any location without a fleet.
* *Travel:* 1 MP: move the active fleet to an adjacent location.
* *Explore:* 1 MP: move the active fleet to an adjacent sector edge on the rim of the galaxy.  It is exploring until a new sector is placed on that edge at the end of the age.
* *Colonize:* 1 MP, strength equal to the number of colonies in the active fleet's location + 1: place a colony in the active fleet's location, if habitable.
* *Skirmish:* All remaining MPs: skirmish with an adjacent fleet.

#### Abilities: Resources
* *Standard:* Reveal a face-down card under any fleet to gain resources equal to its rank, based on its suit.  Then give that card to an opponent.
* *Emergency:* Discard a card from your hand to gain one resource, based on its suit.

* A merchant card gathers wealth, which is spent to move.
* A soldier card gathers strength, which is spent to colonize and reinforce.
* A sage card gathers secrets, which is spent to alter and draw cards.
* A secret may always be spent when you reveal a card to change its suit to whatever you want.

### Pass
Pass your turn.  If you were the first player to pass, take the obelisk (first player marker).  Once all players have passed, continue to the regroup phase.

### Regroup
Clean up for the age in three steps.

1. *Exploration:* In turn order, each player draws sectors for each of their exploring fleets to land on.  Draw in fleet order if you have multiple exploring fleets.  If you can't place a sector on a fleet, put it back on your player mat.  You may warp it in next age.
2. *Draw:* In turn order, each player may pay 0, 1, 3, or 6 secrets to draw 2, 3, 4, or 5 cards.

## Victory
At the end of the fourth age, the player with the most ruling colonies (those on top of a colony stack) wins.  If this is a tie, the player with the most resources left wins.

## Skirmish
Players will add strength to their fleets, then play cards until one decides to retreat and take losses.

### Reinforcement
Both players simultaneously reveal any amount of strength to reinforce their fleets. This strength is then placed with the fleet leader(s), and can’t be moved later.  (Important: fleets have a maximum strength of six.  Reinforcements revealed in excess of six are lost.)

### Initiative Rounds
The weaker fleet (or active player, if tied) has the starting initiative.  The player with initiative may either play a card or retreat.

#### Card Play
Play a card in the suit matching their fleet’s sector (or non-matching suit and a secret). Add the card’s rank [temporarily] to your fleet’s strength and continue initiative rounds.  (If you’re now tied or stronger, the opponent takes initiative.)

#### Retreat
If tied, the skirmish ends and nothing else happens.  Otherwise, you lose strength from the fleet equal to the margin of victory, then the winner moves your fleet that same number of links.  The winner may place colonies on spaces you exit for free.

## Inspiration
* Friedrich and Maria for the skirmish system.
* 7 Ages for the action plotting system and [kinda] trade mechanism.
* Glory to Rome for cards as either simple actions or complex static effects.
* Cosmic Encounter for crazy powers and “last colony ends it”.
* Race for the Galaxy for a tableau of powers triggered by actions.
